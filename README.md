# Reddit Stock Scraper

This is a simple Node based Reddit scraper for finding which stocks are getting the most mentions. As of Mar 2, 2021, this project uses only the following packages:

- Cheerio (for the scraping)
- ESLint (to enforce code quality)
- ESM (to allow the use of import instead of require)
- Node-Fetch (for fetching the data)
- Prompt (to get user input for custom/dynamic results)

## Usage

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

`npm install`

`npm run scrape`

Then simply enter in the subreddit name you wish to scrape (case sensitive), and the number of results you want.

And that's it!
